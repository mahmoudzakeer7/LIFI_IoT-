# LIFI_IoT-
this project can make communication between transmitter and receiver by light 
Li-Fi (Light Fidelity), a wireless communication technology that uses light to transmit data instead of traditional radio frequencies (like Wi-Fi or Bluetooth). Li-Fi has the potential to offer more secure and private communication, as light signals are confined to the area they illuminate and cannot penetrate walls, making it harder for attackers to intercept the data remotely.

# How Li-Fi Works:
Li-Fi uses LED light bulbs to transmit data by modulating the light intensity at extremely high speeds, which is undetectable to the human eye.

A photodetector (receiver) captures the light signals and converts them back into data.

This technology can achieve very high data transfer rates and is more secure because the signal is limited to the line of sight.

Applications for Elderly Care:
Your idea of using Li-Fi for tracking and assisting elderly people is innovative and feasible. Here's how it could work:
Application for Smart Homes too:
you can conntact with devices with light instead of bluetooth or wifi

Device Tracking: Small wearable devices (like wristbands or badges) equipped with Li-Fi receivers and transmitters could communicate with Li-Fi-enabled light fixtures in the home. This would allow caregivers to track the location of the elderly person without intrusive cameras.

Privacy and Security: Since Li-Fi signals are confined to the room, there is less risk of external interference or hacking compared to Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.

Non-Intrusive Monitoring: Instead of installing cameras everywhere, Li-Fi can provide location data and even basic health monitoring (e.g., heart rate, movement) through wearable devices, ensuring privacy while still offering safety.

Emergency Alerts: If an elderly person falls or needs help, the Li-Fi system could immediately alert caregivers by detecting unusual movement or lack of activity.

Advantages of Li-Fi for This Use Case:
Enhanced Privacy: Light signals don't pass through walls, so data is more secure and localized.

No Electromagnetic Interference: Li-Fi doesn't interfere with medical devices or other wireless technologies.

Energy Efficiency: LED lights are already energy-efficient, and using them for communication adds functionality without significant additional power consumption.

# Challenges:
Line of Sight: Li-Fi requires a direct line of sight between the transmitter (light) and receiver (device). Obstacles like furniture or walls can block the signal.

Limited Range: The range of Li-Fi is shorter compared to Wi-Fi, which may require more light fixtures for full coverage.

Device Compatibility: Wearable devices and home infrastructure would need to be equipped with Li-Fi technology.

# for using the system:
we have terminal for user in Tx to choose function that he want to do.
- 1 => turn on motor1
- 2 => turn off motor1
- 3 => turn on motor2
- 4 => turn off motor2
- 5 => turn on lamp
- 6 => turn off lamp
- 7 => turn on lamp
- 8 => turn off lamp
- (+) => increase speed motor1
- (-) => decrease speed motor1
- (*) => increase speed motor2
- (/) => decrease speed motor2

# my future work 
- apply wifi module that integrate my system
- make a website that can user used it to control on the system instead of control with keypad

I will do this soon..
